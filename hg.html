<p id = "">A paragraph is a series of related sentences
     developing a central idea, called the topic.
     Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: 
     a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports 
     one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.</p>

     <p>In linguistics, an adjective is a word that modifies 
        a noun or noun phrase or describes its referent. 
        Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun. 
        Adjectives are one of the main parts of speech of the English language,
     although historically they were classed together with nouns.</p>
